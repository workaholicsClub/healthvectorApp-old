        <item>How many familiar objects can your child identify within his reach (on the floor, in the play-pen, in the room)?</item>
        <item>Do your child’s eyes properly align with each other in the daytime unrelated to his condition like being tired, sick or anxious (cross-eye)?</item>
        <item>Can your child differentiate between symbols of the same type (e.g. differences between letters or numbers)?</item>

        <item>Does the child show Babinski response? Run a thumbnail along the sole from heel to toes: if yes, toes should fan out in response to the stimulation.</item>
        <item>Does the child react to external stimuli? The child should show immediate response to pain in any part of their body, differentiate between hot and cold. Their reaction should be appropriate.</item>
        <item>Does the child give a proper response to the cold, wetness and discomfort (wet diapers, tight shoes)?</item>
        <item>Does the child identify an object as three-dimensional by touching it (e.g. a block on the table seems flat but if you hold it in your hands you realize that it has volume)?</item>
        <item>Does your child recognize familiar objects when they tough them? This can be tested using a block and a ball of the same size and material. First let the child touch one object, name it and show it to them, then the other, then give the objects to the child one after another, then in the end show both the ball and the block and ask what the child had just touched. If the child chooses correctly, the score is perfect.</item>
        <item>Can the child characterize how an object feels (rough, smooth, soft)?</item>
        <item>The child can recognize various items by touch (e.g. tell heads and tails of a coin by touching it) equally with both hands?</item>
